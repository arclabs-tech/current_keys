Please find your login details and essential guidelines below.

*Please replace <username> with your system username or update the key path as per your system's configuration.*

Please be aware of the following strict policies regarding data and resource usage:

* **Limited Data Persistence:** Data persistence is only guaranteed for a period of **5 days**. After 5 days, all your data will be lost.

* **Re-Request Access:** If you require access again after 5 days, you must raise a **new request** through the official forms.
* **Consequence for Non-Compliance:** Failure to comply with these rules will result in you **not being allowed to use** the resources.

General Usage Policies

* **Data Backup:** Even with the 5-day persistence, we strongly recommend you **take a backup of all files** and ensure you push your code and data to external platforms like **GitHub** or **Hugging Face** *before* you end your session by running the `logout` command.
* **Access Location:** You must be physically present on the **PES University campus** and connected to the **PES Wi-Fi** to use this SSH access.
* **Access Timings:** GPU access is permitted **Monday to Friday, from 8:30 AM to 4:00 PM**.
* **Software:** Workstations do not have any pre-installed libraries; you must manually install your necessary libraries. We recommend using Python virtual environments (`venv`).
* **Misuse:** Any misuse of the GPUs or lab resources will result in **severe action**, including a **permanent ban** from ARC Labs facilities.

Support and Further Information

* **Interfaces:** You can use **CodeServer, Jupyter environments**, or the **SSH feature on your IDE** for coding.
